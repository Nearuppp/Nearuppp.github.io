# Scrum Technique 
## Roles
### Product Owner
The product Owner is the person in charge to have the needs of the project.
It is the main product leader. It maintains and communicate a clear vision of the project.
It collaborate with dev team and ScrumMaster.
He is a leader of the team
### Scrum Master
The scrum master is a leader of the process in place to manage the project.
It's protecting the team from impediments that inhabit team productivity.
It does not have authority over the team.
### Dev Team
Usually various software dev jobs.
Up to 9to 5people per scrum team.

## Following
When the product owner deliver his vision it goes through a "grooming" section where the product owner brake down the features in priority list.
This priority list is the 'Product Backlog'
After this moment comes the sprint planning which is a subset of the backlog that the dev team believe they can achieve.
The team members make a second backlog durint the sprint planning called the sprint backlog.
In there a set of detailed tasks and how the team plan to design, build, integrate and test the selected subset of features.
Next execution and maybe after potential shipping.
The team complete the sprint with two inspections and adapt activities. First the sprint review: the stakeholders and scrum team inspect the build and in second : the team scrum inspect the scrum process used.
The outcome goes in a backlog.
And the sprint cycle repeats

'grooming' = refining, estimating and prioritizing a task for a backlog

in practice teams use relative size measure such as story points or ideal days.

Sprints : they have a start and an end date. we do not allow goal altering or personnel during sprint

Sprint Planning : it can be weeks, month. everybody must agree on the definition fo thr upcoming sprint achievement 
They find a sustainable pace which they use tonplanify the sprint backlog.

most of the time Daily Scrum are hold up for 15min to adapt activities. Typical question are : - what did I accomplish since the last faily? - what do inplan to work on by next meeting? - what are the obstacles that are stopping me?

When a sprint is finished we say its done. to ship it we need to have a high level of confidence. Are the client ready for new changes? is there enough feature to ship?

Sprint Review = is the product done? is there anyway we can work better?
Sprint Retrospective = product owner, scrum master and dev team focus on how to better the scrum process

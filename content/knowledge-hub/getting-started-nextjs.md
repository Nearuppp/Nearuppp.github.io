# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications with ease.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints within your Next.js application
- **File-based Routing**: Automatic routing based on file structure

## Installation

To create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure includes:

- `pages/` or `app/` - Your application pages
- `public/` - Static assets
- `styles/` - CSS files
- `components/` - Reusable React components

## Best Practices

1. Use TypeScript for better development experience
2. Implement proper SEO with metadata
3. Optimize images with next/image
4. Use dynamic imports for code splitting
5. Implement proper error handling

## Conclusion

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications with React.

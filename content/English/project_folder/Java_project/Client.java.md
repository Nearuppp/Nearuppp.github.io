## Client.java Overview
The Client.java file is a crucial component of the Java Chat Application, responsible for establishing and managing the connection between an individual client and the server. Its primary goal is to facilitate communication between the client and the server, allowing the user to send and receive messages in real-time.

### Goal of Client.java
The main goal of Client.java is to:
- Establish a connection to the chat server.
- Handle data exchange between the client and server.
- Use threading to ensure smooth and responsive communication.
## How Client.java Works
### Establishing Connection:

1. A Socket object is created to connect to the server using the server's IP address and port number.
```java
Socket socket = new Socket("serverAddress", portNumber);
```
2. Input/Output Streams:

- Input and output streams are set up to facilitate communication. The InputStream reads data from the server, and the OutputStream sends data to the server.
```java
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
```

3. Threading:

- Two threads are typically used: one for reading messages from the server and another for sending messages. This ensures that the client can send and receive messages concurrently without blocking the user interface.
```java
Copy code
Thread readThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        // Code to read messages from the server
    }
});

Thread writeThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        // Code to send messages to the server
    }
});

readThread.start();
writeThread.start();
```
## Detailed Workflow
1. Connection Setup:

- When the client application starts, Client.java establishes a connection to the server using the provided IP address and port number.
2. Message Handling:

- The reading thread continuously listens for incoming messages from the server and processes them (e.g., displaying them to the user).
- The writing thread waits for user input and sends the typed messages to the server.
3. Concurrency:

- By using threads, the client ensures that receiving messages from the server does not block the ability to send messages, creating a seamless chat experience.
### Illustrative Diagram

In summary, **Client.java** is designed to manage the client's end of the chat communication, ensuring a stable and responsive connection to the server. By leveraging Java sockets and threading, it handles real-time message exchange efficiently.

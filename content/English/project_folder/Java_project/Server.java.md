## Server.java Overview
`Server.java` is the backbone of the Java Chat Application, responsible for managing connections, facilitating communication between clients, and maintaining the overall functionality of the chat system. It operates as the central hub where all client requests are processed and responded to.

### Goal of Server.java
The primary goals of `Server.java` are:
- **Connection Management**: Accept connections from multiple clients and manage them efficiently.
- **Message Broadcasting**: Relay messages between clients, ensuring they are delivered to the appropriate recipients.
- **Thread Management**: Handle multiple client connections concurrently using threading.

### How Server.java Works

### 1. Server Initialization
`Server.java` initializes the server by setting up a `ServerSocket` to listen for incoming client connections on a specified port.

- **ServerSocket Creation**: This socket listens for client connection requests.

```java
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(portNumber);
```

#### Features:

- Port Configuration: The server can be configured to listen on a specific port, which is communicated to the clients for connection.
- IP Binding: It binds to a specific IP address, or all available IPs on the server, to accept client connections.
### 2. Handling Client Connections
When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and creates a new thread to handle communication with that client. This approach allows the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking.

- Threading for Clients: Each client connection is managed in its own thread, allowing independent and concurrent communication.

```java
Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
ClientHandler clientHandler = new ClientHandler(clientSocket);
new Thread(clientHandler).start();
```
### Features:

- Scalability: The use of threads enables the server to scale and manage a large number of clients.
- Resource Management: Efficiently handles resources by closing sockets and streams when clients disconnect.
### 3. Message Broadcasting and Handling
The server receives messages from connected clients and broadcasts them to all other clients or specific recipients, depending on the application's design.

- Message Distribution: Messages can be broadcasted to all clients or directed to specific ones (e.g., private messaging).

```java
public void broadcast(String message) {
    for (ClientHandler client : clients) {
        client.sendMessage(message);
    }
}
```

### Features:

- Chat Rooms: Supports chat rooms or channels, allowing messages to be segregated by topics or groups.
- Private Messaging: Implements private messaging, ensuring messages are delivered only to intended recipients.
## Interesting Points and Features
- Concurrency: Server.java leverages threading to handle multiple clients concurrently, providing a responsive experience even with many users.
- Security Measures: May include basic security features like client authentication, message encryption, or IP banning to prevent unauthorized access.
- Logging and Monitoring: Tracks server activities and client interactions, which is crucial for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Scalability: Designed to scale horizontally, allowing multiple instances of the server to handle increased load, possibly with load balancing.

In summary, Server.java is the central component that makes the Java Chat Application function effectively. It manages client connections, handles message broadcasting, and ensures smooth and concurrent communication across the system. This structure not only facilitates a seamless chat experience but also allows for future expansion and feature enhancement.

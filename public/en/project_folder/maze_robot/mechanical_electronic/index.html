  "articleBody": "Mechanical and Electronic Integration in Robotics Overview The primary objective was to maximize the compatibility of mechanical components to ensure optimal arrangement of all electronic equipment on the robot. Although the main support was provided, the mechanical assembly was very detailed. The robot’s chassis was designed to support all parts, except for the distance sensors. This solid and well-optimized support facilitated the integration of other components.\nTo ensure a straightforward and optimized use of the robot, a new part was created to fit perfectly with the existing structure. This part allows the attachment of three sensors at strategic points on the robot.\nBase Structure of the Robot The robot shares a common base structure across all groups. The mechanical assembly involves putting together various parts of the robot in a practical and optimized manner to accommodate electronic components in the desired locations. The initial step was to assemble the robot’s base using the parts provided in the starter kit.\nAvailable Mechanical Parts Common PLA Structure: This structure serves as the foundation for all components of the robot, whether mechanical or electronic. Pair of Wheels: These wheels, compatible with the provided servomotors, are driven by rotational motion, propelling the robot forward. They are one of the two parts in direct contact with the track. Multidirectional Ball: Like the wheels, this ball provides stability to the robot, allowing it to rest on three points. It follows the robot’s movement naturally, permitting control with only two servomotors. Assembled Robot After assembly, space for the battery and Arduino board was already designated and ready for use. However, an additional area for the distance sensors, crucial for the robot’s operation, was required.\nCreation of an Additional Support To effectively utilize the distance sensors, essential for navigating a maze, a new support was designed and created. This support is optimized for the three sensors, enabling them to function as needed for the project.\nDesign Process The support was modeled using Onshape, with a straightforward layout: one sensor pointing forward and two on the sides. This arrangement is optimal for detecting front and lateral distances in a maze environment, where paths are perpendicular to each other.\nAssembly and Placement The sensors were integrated into the structure to minimize the robot’s overall volume. Two notches on each side of the support allowed it to be securely attached to the pre-designed chassis of the robot.\nThe design accounted for a tolerance of approximately 0.4 mm due to the printing process, ensuring proper fitting for both the support and the sensors. This meticulous design allows for the optimal positioning and operation of the sensors, unobstructed by external elements like cables.\n",
